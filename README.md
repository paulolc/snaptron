It's snap, the visual, blocks based programming language stuffed in electron to control mBots.

Still not in a usable state. A lot of stuff is missing to get this to work even in a minimal way.
Some blocks are in portuguese and only mBots are supported for the moment.

Meanwhile you can use Snap4Arduino or mBlock.
